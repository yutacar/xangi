# Design Document

This document explains the architecture and design philosophy of xangi.

## Overview

xangi is "a wrapper that makes AI CLIs (Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor CLI / Grok CLI / Antigravity CLI) and local LLMs (Ollama, etc.) accessible from chat platforms."

```
User → Chat (Discord/Slack) → xangi → AI CLI → Workspace
```

## Components

### Entry Point (index.ts)

A thin entry point dedicated to the startup sequence. It is responsible only for the following; the actual implementation of each feature lives in separate modules:

- Configuration loading and validation (`config.ts` / `config-validate.ts`)
- Startup branching for the enabled clients (Discord / Slack / Web Chat / LINE / Telegram; a Web-only setup does not create a Discord Client)
- Starting the scheduler and the various HTTP servers (tool-server / events-stream / event-trigger / approval-server, etc.)
- SIGTERM/SIGINT handling (graceful shutdown, including the finalization pass in `stream-finalizer.ts`)

### Discord Integration (src/discord/)

Based on `discord.js` v14. Split into modules by responsibility:

- `message-handler.ts` — MessageCreate/Update/Delete handling and `processPrompt` (mention / DM / `discordAutoReplyChannels` in `settings.json` → forwarding to the Runner; Discord system messages are ignored)
- `slash-commands.ts` — Slash command definitions and interaction handling
- `scheduler-bridge.ts` — Registers the scheduler's Discord sender and agent-runner functions. Processing messages started by schedules / triggers are also registered with the processing-message UI so Stop / extend / remaining-time controls match the normal message path
- `ui.ts` — Button rows (Stop / extend / remaining-time display) and processing-message management
- `tool-history.ts` — Tool history formatting/accumulation (display lines capped via `TOOL_HISTORY_MAX_LINES`)
- `message-utils.ts` — Discord message link expansion, reply quoting, thread-starter quoting, channel-mention expansion

Behavior:

- Per-channel / per-thread session isolation (`contextKey = discord:<channelId>`; when thread-reply mode creates a new thread, `discord:<threadId>`)
- Discord API posting targets the parent channel or the created thread, while runner / timeout / Stop / processing state use the resolved `runKey = contextKey`, so separate threads in the same Discord channel do not share an execution slot
- Per-channel settings inside Discord threads resolve through the parent channel ID. This means `CHANNEL_OVERRIDES` (`/backend` / `/llmmode`), `settings.json` (`/autoreply` / `/notify` / `/threadmode`), and channel topic injection inherit the parent channel configuration
- For messages inside an existing Discord thread, xangi injects the starter message from the parent channel as `🧵 スレッド元` so the agent focuses on the thread's original topic even when thread-local history does not include it
- Threads, attachments, and reactions supported
- Streaming display uses `stream-session.ts` (a core shared with Slack / Web) to unify thinking display and update throttling, and refreshes the button UI at 1-second granularity via `message.edit`
- On process shutdown (SIGTERM), `stream-finalizer.ts` finalizes in-flight streaming displays into a "⏸ interrupted by process restart" notice (registered on both the message-handler and scheduler-bridge paths)

### Slack Integration (slack.ts)

Based on `@slack/bolt`.

- Handles `app_mention` and DMs; per-thread session isolation (`contextKey = <channelId>:<threadTs>`)
- Handles normal `message` events, user `/me` posts (`me_message`), and attachment-bearing `file_share` events, while ignoring other Slack system subtypes such as channel renames
- Handles follow-up messages without mentions inside active threads that xangi started from a mention, while ignoring unrelated thread replies in non-auto-reply channels
- Keeps Slack API posting on `channelId`, but uses `runKey = contextKey` for runner / timeout / Stop / processing state so separate threads in the same Slack channel do not share an execution slot
- Prevents duplicate runs with a per-`runKey` busy lock, message timestamp de-dupe, and message-handler bot-mention skip so `app_mention` owns mention events
- Shows formatted tool-history lines while a Slack turn is running, then hides the final history behind a `Tools` button visible only to the clicking user
- Slash commands and reactions supported
- Stop / extend / remaining-time button rows are refreshed every second via `chat.update`
- For non-thread turns, xangi posts a separate `✅ 完了しました（...）` completion notice after long runs to improve visibility

### Web Chat (web-chat.ts)

Lightweight server based on `http.createServer` (no Express dependency).

- Per-pane session isolation (`contextKey = web:<paneId>`), exposed on `WEB_CHAT_PORT`
- SSE delivers streaming responses plus timeout events (`timeout-started/extended/cleared`) to the frontend
- The frontend ticks every second to update the remaining time (no additional API calls)
- File upload / download accepted extensions are gated by `WEB_CHAT_UPLOAD_ACCEPT` / `WEB_CHAT_DOWNLOAD_ACCEPT`
- `GET /api/sessions` includes an `activity` snapshot for each managed session. `activity-store.ts` keeps the current turn state, summary, recent tool lines, and elapsed seconds in process memory
- `/monitor` is a read-only session monitoring page. It polls the same `/api/sessions` endpoint every 2 seconds and sorts running sessions first. Rows and text are sized for phone and Even G2 viewing

### LINE Bot Integration (line.ts)

1:1 chat via LINE Messaging API. Design:

- `http.createServer`-based (matches `web-chat.ts`, avoids the Express dependency)
- Uses `@line/bot-sdk`'s `validateSignature` for raw-body + `X-Line-Signature` HMAC-SHA256 verification
- Passes text messages through `runWithBubbleEvents` to the Runner, then replies via `LineBotClient.replyMessage`
- Per-userId session isolation (`contextKey = line:<userId>`)
- `LINE_ALLOWED_USER` whitelist (`*` allows all, empty causes a startup error)
- Acks the webhook immediately (LINE expects HTTP 200 within 30 s; the rest is async)

#### Two-stage responsiveness defense (loading animation + reply→push auto-switch)

LINE has no thread or "new chat" UI boundary like Slack or Discord, and reply tokens expire 60 s after the inbound event. Long thinking time or local-LLM tool loops can easily turn into "ghosted" experiences. Two layered defenses cover this:

1. **Instant ACK — Loading animation API**: Right after the allowlist check (before the runner starts), `handleEvent` calls `client.showLoadingAnimation({ chatId, loadingSeconds })` which hits LINE's official `POST /v2/bot/chat/loading/start`. The "typing…" indicator appears in the chat immediately and disappears when the bot sends its next message. Failure is non-fatal (`console.warn` only). DM-only feature (groups are ignored by LINE, but the API call still succeeds). Duration is controlled by `LINE_LOADING_ANIMATION_SECONDS` (default 60; `snapLoadingSeconds` snaps to one of 5/10/15/20/25/30/40/50/60). Disable with `LINE_LOADING_ANIMATION_ENABLED=false`.

2. **Reply→Push auto-switch — Slow response fallback**: A `setTimeout` armed with `LINE_SLOW_RESPONSE_THRESHOLD_MS` (default 45000 ms). When it fires, the reply token is consumed by sending `🤔 ちょっと待ってね、考えてる…` (the `slowFiredRef` flag is set). After the runner finishes, the send path is chosen from `slowFiredRef.value` and `elapsedMs`:
   - `slowFiredRef.value === true` → reply token consumed; must use Push API
   - `slowFiredRef.value === false` and `elapsedMs < threshold` → reply token still valid → use reply
   - Otherwise → safe fallback to Push

   If reply fails afterwards, push is retried as a secondary fallback (both failures are logged via `console.error`). Set `LINE_SLOW_RESPONSE_ENABLED=false` to disable, but responses over 60 s would then be lost entirely (not recommended).

   The Push API is free for the first 200 messages/month on personal Official Accounts; usage beyond is billed. If slow responses are frequent on a local LLM (Gemma, etc.), increase the threshold or use a faster inference backend.

#### Session boundaries (idle reset + reset command)

LINE has no explicit conversation boundary UI like Slack's threads or Discord's "new chat" button. xangi switches sessions using a two-layer time-based + command-based approach:

1. **Reset-command detection**: In `handleEvent`, right after the allowlist check and before the loading animation or runner, `isResetCommand(text, patterns)` checks for an exact match (case-insensitive, whitespace stripped). On match, the active session is archived via `archiveSession()`, a new one is created via `ensureSession()`, "最初からお話するね！何かあった？" is sent via `replyMessage`, and the function returns without invoking the runner. Default patterns are limited to three unambiguous slash commands: `/reset` `/new` `/clear`. The idle reset (time-based) is the primary boundary; commands serve as a manual escape hatch. Japanese natural-language phrases have fuzzy boundaries against neighboring phrases ("リセットってどういう意味？", "最初からお話したい"), so they are excluded from defaults and must be added explicitly via `LINE_RESET_TEXT_PATTERNS` (CSV) if needed.
2. **Idle session reset**: For non-reset messages, if the current session's `updatedAt` is older than `LINE_IDLE_RESET_HOURS` (default 4 h), `hasSessionGoneIdle()` returns true → `archiveSession()` is called, then `ensureSession()` creates a new session. Children's conversations cluster naturally around school / sleep / meal patterns, so 4 h is a good cut. The `logs/sessions/*.jsonl` files are kept after archiving, so history is preserved.

Both features can be disabled independently (`LINE_IDLE_RESET_ENABLED=false`, `LINE_RESET_TEXT_PATTERNS=`). Combined with Rich Menu button bindings ("Start over" → sends `リセット` → reset-command detection path), this gives a clean integrated experience.

The public endpoint is provided externally (Tailscale Funnel / Cloudflare Tunnel). See [`docs/en/line-setup.md`](line-setup.md).

### Telegram Bot Integration (telegram.ts)

Supports messaging via Telegram Bot API. Design:

- Uses `grammy` library. Supports both webhook and long polling startup modes (long polling is the default).
- Monitors text messages (`message:text`) and processes only DMs and authorized group chats.
- Performs allowlist validation for authorized user IDs (`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER`) and authorized bot IDs (`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_BOTS`).
- For group chats, begins responses on bot mention, reply to bot, or message detection in `TELEGRAM_AUTO_REPLY_CHATS`.
- Strips the `@xangi_bot` mention automatically before passing text to the Runner.
- Implements an infinite reply loop guard (`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_BOTS_MAX_CONSECUTIVE`) that caps consecutive replies to the same bot.
- Updates the thinking/streaming process inline using `editMessageText` at a 1-second interval powered by `StreamSession`.
- Caps individual messages to Telegram's 4096-character limit and splits longer text using `splitMessage`.
- Handles session reset commands (`/reset`, `/new`, `/clear`), run cancellations (`/stop`), and simple help guidance (`/help`).

### Agent Runner (agent-runner.ts)

An interface that abstracts AI CLIs:

```typescript
interface AgentRunner {
  run(prompt: string, options?: RunOptions): Promise<RunResult>;
  runStream(prompt: string, callbacks: StreamCallbacks, options?: RunOptions): Promise<RunResult>;
  cancel?(channelId?: string): boolean;
  destroy?(channelId: string): boolean;
  hasRunner?(channelId: string): boolean;
  /** Returns the active request's timeout state for UI countdown */
  getTimeoutState?(channelId: string): TimeoutState;
  /** Called by the +5m button to extend the active request's timeout */
  extendTimeout?(channelId: string, additionalMs: number): ExtendTimeoutResult;
}
```

Every Runner implementation (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Grok / Antigravity / Local LLM / Dynamic) is also
an `EventEmitter` and emits `timeout-started` / `timeout-extended` / `timeout-cleared`
events so upstream consumers (web-chat SSE / Discord bot / Slack bot) can refresh the UI.

### Activity Store (activity-store.ts)

`runWithBubbleEvents` updates a lightweight snapshot of the current turn from the shared lifecycle.

- `turn.started` equivalent sets `thinking`
- `onText` sets `streaming`
- `onToolUse` sets `tool` and records recent tool lines
- `onComplete` / cancel / error set `complete` / `aborted` / `error`
- Snapshots are process-memory only. They are not restored after restart and do not write to `sessions.json` or transcripts
- `GET /api/sessions` and the Even Terminal compatible `GET /api/sessions?provider=...` read the same activity data

### Timeout Controller (timeout-controller.ts)

A shared helper that centralizes per-channel timeout state for every runner:

```typescript
class TimeoutController extends EventEmitter {
  start(channelId, onTimeout): void; // start request + emit 'timeout-started'
  clear(channelId, reason): void; // completed / error + emit 'timeout-cleared'
  extend(channelId, additionalMs): ExtendTimeoutResult; // extend + emit 'timeout-extended'
  getState(channelId): TimeoutState; // UI consumption
  clearAll(reason): void; // shutdown cleanup
}
```

- `start()` schedules `setTimeout(onTimeout, baseTimeoutMs)`
- `extend()` reschedules the timer and rejects with `max_timeout_exceeded` if the new
  deadline would exceed `maxTimeoutAt` (request start time + 1 hour)
- `onTimeout` looks up the _current_ AbortController / child process so that retries
  swapping out the underlying resource still get killed on timeout

### Dynamic Runner Manager (dynamic-runner.ts)

A wrapper that dynamically switches backend, model, and effort per channel:

```
Message received
  → BackendResolver.resolve(channelId)
  → Retrieve { backend, model, effort }
  → DynamicRunnerManager routes to the appropriate runner
  → Execute
```

BackendResolver priority:

1. channelOverrides set via `/backend set` (in-memory, persisted to CHANNEL_OVERRIDES in `.env`; Discord threads resolve through the parent channel ID)
2. Defaults from `.env` (`AGENT_BACKEND`, `AGENT_MODEL`)

### System Prompt (base-runner.ts)

Manages the system prompts that xangi injects into AI CLIs:

- **Chat platform info** — A short fixed text indicating the conversation is via Discord/Slack
- **XANGI_COMMANDS** — Injects platform-specific command specifications from `src/prompts/`
  - Common commands (`xangi-commands-common.ts`): Timeout handling, etc.
  - Chat platform common (`xangi-commands-chat-platform.ts`): File sending (MEDIA:), message separators (===), scheduling, system commands
  - Discord-specific (`xangi-commands-discord.ts`): `xangi-cmd discord_*` CLI tools, auto-expand
  - Slack-specific (`xangi-commands-slack.ts`): Slack-specific operations
  - Automatic platform detection: If only Discord is active, only Discord-specific commands are injected (saves tokens)
- **Platform identification** — Each message is annotated with `[Platform: Discord]` or `[Platform: Slack]`. The AI uses the appropriate commands accordingly
- **Tool-use display** — Discord tool-use history is controlled by `DISCORD_TOOL_HISTORY_MODE=button|inline|off`. The default is `button`: completed messages do not include the history inline, and a `Tools` button shows it only to the user who clicked it via an ephemeral response. Slack uses the same `Tools` button pattern and does not inline tool history in the completed message. `DISCORD_SHOW_TOOL_BUTTON=false` hides the Tools button for Discord even in `button` mode. `inline` keeps the previous top-of-message display, and `off` disables tool history display. For compatibility, `DISCORD_SHOW_TOOL_USE=false` maps to `off` and `true` maps to `inline`. While a turn is running, xangi shows raw commands unless `DISCORD_SHOW_LIVE_TOOL_USE=false`. After completion it normalizes internal context tools into short labels such as `workspace-RAG検索`; Bash/exec final history strips wrappers such as `/bin/bash -lc` and shows a shorter command summary. Live Bash/exec tool argument display is capped at 200 characters and can be configured with `XANGI_TOOL_DISPLAY_MAX`.
- **Reply suggestions** — Discord, Slack, and Web Chat generate suggestions in a dedicated JSON block within the same AI response and remove that block before display. Discord and Slack expose one public `返信候補` button and reveal choices ephemerally to the requesting user. Web Chat uses a collapsed control below the response. Selecting a choice continues the same session. Discord's `/replysuggestions` command persists a global override in `settings.json`; every platform checks it immediately before processing a message. OFF skips suggestion prompt injection. Session titles and transcript views also remove history-prefetch and suggestion-generation metadata.

AGENTS.md / CHARACTER.md / USER.md and other workspace settings are delegated to each AI CLI's auto-loading feature:

#### Shared One-shot CLI Runner Core (cli-runner-core.ts)

The five adapters (claude-code / codex-cli / cursor-cli / grok-cli / antigravity-cli) are built on the
abstract base class `CliRunnerBase`. The base class owns the shared scaffolding, so each
adapter only implements "command argument building" and "JSONL event interpretation
(`CliStreamParser`)":

- **Process management**: spawn, registration/cleanup in `processManager` / `activeProcesses`, `cancel` / `hasRunner`
- **Timeouts**: integration with `TimeoutController` (remaining-time UI / extension). Requests
  without a channelId are outside the controller's scope, so a fixed fallback timer covers them
- **JSONL buffering**: assembling lines split across chunks (`jsonl-buffer.ts`) and flushing
  the trailing buffer after process exit
- **Exit error construction**: priority "CLI error event body > stderr > exit code only", so
  real reasons such as usage-limit errors are surfaced instead of swallowed (all adapters)
- **Centralized error notification**: `callbacks.onError` is invoked only by the base class.
  The first attempt before a stale-session retry uses `notifyOnError: false` to suppress
  spurious error notifications
- **Stale session auto-recovery**: resume failures with an invalidated sessionId are detected
  and retried once with a fresh session (all runners: claude-code / codex / cursor / grok)

#### Local LLM Adapter Detailed Design

**Session Retry Flow:**

```
1. Add user message to session history
   ↓
2. Send request to LLM API
   ↓
3a. Success → Return tool loop or final response
3b. Error occurred
   ↓
4. Evaluate error with isSessionRelatedError()
   - context length exceeded / too many tokens / max_tokens / context window
   - invalid message / malformed / 400 / 422
   ↓
5a. Session-related error → Clear session (keep only last user message) → Retry
5b. Not session-related → Generate user-facing message with formatLlmError() and return
   ↓
6. Retry also failed → Return error message via formatLlmError()
```

**Tool Calling Flow (llm-client.ts):**

The LLM client has two API paths: Ollama native API and OpenAI-compatible API. Note the different message formats for tool calling:

| Item                     | OpenAI-compatible API           | Ollama Native API                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Assistant tool calls     | Identified by `tool_calls[].id` | Identified by `tool_calls[].function` |
| Tool message association | `tool_call_id` (by ID)          | `tool_name` (by name)                 |
| Conversion function      | `toOpenAIMessages()`            | `toOllamaMessages()`                  |

In the Ollama native path, a reverse lookup map from `toolCallId` to `tool_name` is used for association. `toOllamaMessages()` is shared by both `chatOllamaNative` and `chatStreamOllamaNative` so tool history is never dropped on the streaming path.

**`chatStream` with tools / tool_choice (OpenAI-compatible streaming path):**

`chatStream` carries `tools` / `tool_choice` in the payload, same as `chatOpenAI`. Without `tools` on the streaming path, when the LLM decides a tool call is needed it falls back to emitting a pseudo tool_call string as plain text (e.g. `<|tool_call>call:fn{args}<tool_call|>`) — a format drift observed in practice with Gemma 4 26B-A4B-NVFP4 on vLLM.

`LLMChatOptions.toolChoice`:

| Value                                      | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `'auto'`                                   | LLM decides (OpenAI default)                       |
| `'none'`                                   | Forces text-only reply (used for the final answer) |
| `'required'`                               | Forces a tool call                                 |
| `{ type: 'function', function: { name } }` | Forces a specific tool                             |

`executeStreamLoop` sets `toolChoice='none'` on the final chatStream call so the model cannot try to call another tool — preventing the pseudo tool_call text leak after the tool loop has completed. Codex CLI's Responses API sends streaming and tools/tool_choice as a single integrated request (`codex-rs/core/src/client.rs`); xangi-dev stays on Chat Completions but achieves the equivalent effect via `tool_choice='none'`.

**Ollama native path: tools / tool_choice:**

The Ollama native API (`/api/chat`) also carries `tools` in the payload in both `chatOllamaNative` and `chatStreamOllamaNative`. When `LOCAL_LLM_THINKING=false` and the URL contains `11434` / `ollama` (the `isOllamaUrl()` check), `chatStream` dispatches to `chatStreamOllamaNative`. If `tools` were missing on this path, the same format drift seen on the Gemma 4 / vLLM path (pseudo tool_call strings leaking as text in the final answer; the actual reply body not being generated) would occur for Ollama-hosted models like Qwen3.6 as well.

The Ollama native API does not officially support the OpenAI `tool_choice` parameter (it is silently ignored). Therefore `toolChoice='none'` is **emulated by not sending `tools` at all** — with no tools available, the LLM cannot call one, which is equivalent to forcing a text reply. `toolChoice='auto'` / `'required'` keeps `tools` in the body but omits `tool_choice` itself (best-effort; Ollama ignores it).

**Shared helpers (4-path consistency guarantee):**

To ensure the four paths (`chat` / `chatStream` × OpenAI / Ollama) inject tools and convert messages identically with no drift, the following helpers are consolidated at the top of `src/local-llm/llm-client.ts`:

| Helper                            | Purpose                                                              | Callers                                      |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `applyOpenAITools(body, options)` | Inject OpenAI-style tools/tool_choice                                | `chatOpenAI`, `chatStream` (OpenAI branch)   |
| `applyOllamaTools(body, options)` | Inject Ollama-style tools + emulate `tool_choice='none'`             | `chatOllamaNative`, `chatStreamOllamaNative` |
| `toOllamaMessages(messages)`      | Convert LLMMessage → Ollama format (images / tool_calls / tool_name) | `chatOllamaNative`, `chatStreamOllamaNative` |

Adding new behavior (extra tool_choice values, new message fields, new providers) only requires touching one helper to reflect across all four paths. The test suite (`tests/local-llm-client-ollama-tools.test.ts`) covers both the helper units and the Ollama payload at the integration level.

**Error Handling Design:**

- `isSessionRelatedError()` — Lowercases the Error instance message and checks if it matches known patterns caused by session history. Always returns false for non-Error objects
- `formatLlmError()` — Converts connection errors, timeouts, authentication errors, rate limits, and server errors into clear user-friendly messages. Returns a default message for non-Error objects
- Context trimming (`trimSession()`) — Executes tool result truncation, message count limiting, and total character limiting with recent message protection (limits are computed dynamically; see the Context Budget section below)

**Context Budget Dynamic Calculation (runner.ts: `loadContextBudget`):**

To align xangi's session limit with the LLM's `--max-model-len` (vLLM) or `num_ctx` (Ollama), trimming thresholds are derived from env vars. The hardcoded `CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS=120000` is removed.

Priority:

1. If `LOCAL_LLM_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` is set explicitly → use it (highest priority)
2. Otherwise, derive from `LOCAL_LLM_NUM_CTX` (default 32768):

```
historyTokens   = NUM_CTX - SYSTEM_PROMPT_BUDGET - OUTPUT_BUDGET - SAFETY_MARGIN
contextMaxChars = max(historyTokens * CHARS_PER_TOKEN, 8000)   # 1 token ≈ 3 chars (conservative for JA-mixed)
```

Example: with `NUM_CTX=32768` → `(32768 - 8000 - 4096 - 1000) * 3 = 59016 chars`.

| env                                     | Role                                     | Default      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `LOCAL_LLM_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS`           | Explicit override (skip derivation)      | Auto-derived |
| `LOCAL_LLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BUDGET_TOKENS` | Tokens reserved for the system prompt    | `8000`       |
| `LOCAL_LLM_OUTPUT_BUDGET_TOKENS`        | Max output tokens per request            | `4096`       |
| `LOCAL_LLM_SAFETY_MARGIN_TOKENS`        | Safety margin                            | `1000`       |
| `LOCAL_LLM_CONTEXT_KEEP_LAST`           | Most recent N messages are never trimmed | `10`         |
| `LOCAL_LLM_TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS`       | Tool result truncation                   | `4000`       |
| `LOCAL_LLM_MAX_SESSION_MESSAGES`        | Max messages per session                 | `50`         |

The `ContextBudget` value includes derivation details (`source: 'explicit' | 'derived'`, per-token budgets) and is logged at startup for tuning/debugging traceability.

**Per-channel LocalLlmMode Override (backend-resolver.ts):**

`ChannelOverride.localLlmMode?: 'agent' | 'lite' | 'chat'` sits alongside `backend / model / effort`, allowing per-channel Local LLM mode via `CHANNEL_OVERRIDES` JSON.

```json
{
  "ch_id": {
    "backend": "local-llm",
    "model": "gemma4-26b-a4b-nvfp4",
    "localLlmMode": "agent"
  }
}
```

`MODE_DEFAULTS` (runner.ts):

| mode    | tools | skills | xangiCommands | triggers |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ------------- | -------- |
| `agent` | ✅    | ✅     | ✅            | –        |
| `lite`  | ✅    | –      | ✅            | ✅       |
| `chat`  | –     | –      | –             | –        |

**Per-call application flow:**

```
RunOptions.localLlmMode (DynamicAgentRunner injects resolved.localLlmMode)
   ↓
runner.run() / runStream() calls resolveCallModeFlags(callMode) → ModeFlags
   ↓
buildSystemPrompt(flags) and llmTools = callFlags.tools ? getAllTools() : []
are recomputed per-call
```

Note: individual env vars at startup (e.g. `LOCAL_LLM_TOOLS=false`) are **ignored** when a per-call override is supplied — `MODE_DEFAULTS` are applied directly.

**`/llmmode` slash command (index.ts):**

`/llmmode <agent|lite|chat|default|show>` flips the per-channel mode interactively. `agent/lite/chat` invokes `BackendResolver.setChannelLocalLlmMode()` for in-memory + `.env` persistence. `default` clears the override. `show` displays the currently resolved mode. The command is disabled by `ALLOW_LLM_MODE_COMMAND=false` (default `true`).

**Tool Deferred Loading (`tool_search`, Codex / Claude Code style):**

Passing every tool schema on every turn pressures the context and triggers format drift / mis-selection on Local LLMs. Inspired by Codex CLI's `tool_search` (stable=true, `TOOL_SEARCH_DEFAULT_LIMIT=8`) and Claude Code's `ToolSearch`, we activate tool schemas on demand.

Design pillars:

1. **Always-loaded set (per-process default)**: `loadAlwaysLoadedToolNames(env)` reads `LOCAL_LLM_ALWAYS_LOADED_TOOLS` at startup. If unset, the default is `read,write,edit,exec,glob,grep,send_file,web_fetch,tool_search`. `tool_search` is always included unconditionally (it is the entry point to call deferred tools)
2. **Active set (per-session)**: `Session.activeToolNames: Set<string>` is initialised from the always-loaded set and is dynamically extended by `tool_search` results
3. **Recomputed each iteration**: At the top of each `executeAgentLoop` / `executeStreamLoop` iteration, `getActiveTools(session.activeToolNames)` rebuilds the schema list passed to `body.tools`. Newly activated tools become callable **on the next turn**
4. **Deferred catalog rendering**: `buildSystemPrompt` adds a "Deferred Tools (load on demand via tool_search)" section listing the names + descriptions of deferred tools (no schemas — token-saving)

`tool_search` scoring (`scoreToolMatch`):

| Match type                 | Score       |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| Exact name match           | 100         |
| Substring of name          | 50          |
| Query token in name        | +20 / token |
| Query token in description | +10 / token |

Top N results (`LOCAL_LLM_TOOL_SEARCH_LIMIT`, default 8) are sorted by descending score and added to the session via the `context.activateTools(names)` callback.

**Tool activation callback (types.ts: `ToolContext.activateTools`):**

```ts
interface ToolContext {
  workspace: string;
  channelId?: string;
  activateTools?: (names: string[]) => void; // invoked from tool_search
}
```

`runner.executeAgentLoop` injects `(names) => session.activeToolNames.add(...names)` into the context when calling executeTool. This completes the loop: `tool_search` → search → expand active set → next iteration's reasoning can call the targeted tool.

| env                             | Role                                                          | Default                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `LOCAL_LLM_TOOL_SEARCH_ENABLED` | Enable deferred loading                                       | `true`                     |
| `LOCAL_LLM_TOOL_SEARCH_LIMIT`   | Max hits per search                                           | `8`                        |
| `LOCAL_LLM_ALWAYS_LOADED_TOOLS` | Always-loaded tool names (CSV); `tool_search` is always added | builtin core + tool_search |

To revert to the legacy behaviour (all tools always loaded), set `LOCAL_LLM_TOOL_SEARCH_ENABLED=false`.

Trade-off: a deferred tool's first call requires a `tool_search` round-trip → +1 turn. Description quality directly affects search accuracy.

**Tool failure → LLM self-correction recovery loop (Step A–D):**

Some local LLMs loop on the same `tool_search` query up to `MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` when no useful results come back, then hallucinate pseudo tool_call text (`<|channel>thought\ncall:fn{args}<channel|>` / bare `call:fn{args}`) in the final chatStream — leaking drift into the final response. A naive post-process strip would just hide the symptom; the LLM never learns it produced invalid output and re-emits the same drift next turn. Instead we **feed the failure back to the LLM and let it self-correct**.

Drift classification:

- **Strict drift** (`STRICT_DRIFT_PATTERNS`): structurally suggests the real response is missing or replaced → triggers Step C feedback.
- **Cosmetic leak** (`COSMETIC_LEAK_PATTERNS`): bare leading/trailing `thought\n` etc., the body itself is fine but a marker leaked → silent strip via `stripPseudoToolCalls`, no retry.

The session tracks `recentToolCallSigs: string[]` (capped at 8, FIFO). `toolCallSignature(name, args)` normalises with sorted JSON keys to make the signature order-independent. `REPEATED_TOOL_CALL_THRESHOLD=3` triggers the loop detection.

**Layered loop detection / drift suppression / context compaction:**

Step B (exact 3-times) is the starting point; six cooperating mechanisms cover "same tool being repeated", "pseudo tool_call drift surfacing to Discord", "bot intent lost on drift", and "context bloat from accumulated tool results":

Loop up to `Kmax=2`; on exhaustion fall through to `FRIENDLY_FALLBACK_MESSAGE` (Step D) |

API: `recordToolCallAndDetectLoop(session, sig)` returns `{ kind: 'none' \| 'exact' \| 'similar', repeats? }` so `executeRunLoop` / `executeStreamLoop` can pick `repeatedToolCallErrorMessage` vs `similarToolCallErrorMessage` based on `kind`. `recordToolCallAndCheckLoop` is preserved as a boolean wrapper for backward compatibility. `compactOldToolResults(session, recentKeepCount)` returns `{ compactedCount, bytesReclaimed }` and runs at the top of `trimSession`. `parsePseudoToolCall(text)` decomposes `call:fn{args}` into `{name, args}` via anchored grammar (returns `null` on failure). `isSafeForRescue(name, args)` returns `{safe, reason?}`.

Role separation across the six mechanisms:

- **exact**: identical args 3 times in a row → definite loop. Counted via `Session.recentToolCallSigs`.
- **idempotent cache**: same computation/encoding with identical args → skip `exec`, return cached result on the 2nd call (the loop never reaches detection).
- **similar**: tiny wording tweaks repeating the "same intent" → broader net than exact (trigram Jaccard).
- **hold buffer**: suppress pseudo tool_call rendering during streaming → blocks chunks before they leave for Discord, sitting in front of Step C/D.
- **context prune**: compact old tool results into one-line summaries → even when the same intent slips past the loop guards, the conversation context stops bloating, leaving headroom under `trimSession`'s total char budget.
- **rescue + structured feedback**: salvage the bot's intent when it leaked as a pseudo tool_call instead of dropping it — execute it if safe, otherwise return a structured error that guides the LLM toward proper function calling. Acts as the final layer before falling back to a generic apology.

Generic guidance lives in `TOOLS_USAGE_PROMPT` ("don't repeat the same tool with tiny arg tweaks", "the idempotent cache and loop detection are watching", "if results are thin: different args / different tool / stop"). Skill-specific constraints (the 195-character limit for `sns-post-*`, URL encoding for `note-taking`, etc.) belong in each skill's `SKILL.md`; the shared `TOOLS_USAGE_PROMPT` no longer carries skill-specific `wc -c` / `urllib.parse` / `base64` examples, keeping the separation of concerns.

Design rationale: Step A's skill hinting is usually decisive — by surfacing "what to do next" in the `tool_search` result, the LLM is routed into the canonical path (`read SKILL.md` → run the script described in the skill). B / C / D act as fail-safes layered behind A, with the six-stage defence (exact / idempotent cache / similar / hold buffer / context prune / rescue + structured feedback) splitting responsibility so no single mechanism has to handle every failure mode.

#### Rescue allowlist (safety gate)

`isSafeForRescue(name, args)` decides whether a parsed pseudo tool_call may be executed. We avoid a denylist approach (rejecting specific dangerous commands like `rm/curl/git`) because such lists are easy to bypass; instead, only an explicit allowlist is permitted:

| Category                    | Allowed                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct read-only tools      | `read` / `glob` / `grep` / `tool_search` / `discord_history` / `web_history` / `slack_history` / `discord_channels` / `discord_search` / `slack_channels` / `slack_search` / `schedule_list` |
| `exec` / `bash` subcommands | Only commands starting with `xangi-cmd {discord_history,web_history,slack_history,discord_channels,discord_search,slack_channels,slack_search,schedule_list,system_settings}`                |
| Shell metacharacters        | If the command contains any of `\|` / `&` / `;` / `` ` `` / `$` / `<` / `>` / `$(...)` / `&&` / `\|\|` / `>` redirect → immediate reject                                                     |

Anything else returns `{safe: false, reason}`, leading to an `unsafe_tool_in_pseudo_format` structured error that nudges the LLM toward the proper function_calling structure.

#### Structured error record

`buildStructuredFeedback(record)` produces a system message wrapping `{kind, attempted_tool?, attempted_args?, reason, hint, allowed_actions}` with `[SYSTEM ERROR RECORD] ... [END SYSTEM ERROR RECORD]` delimiters. The delimiters discourage the LLM from copy-pasting the JSON into its own reply.

`kind` enum:

- `pseudo_format_drift`: generic drift detected
- `unsafe_tool_in_pseudo_format`: parsed successfully but rejected by the safety gate
- `already_executed`: same signature hit the idempotent cache or loop detection (no re-execution)
- `unparseable_pseudo_call`: drift detected but parsing failed (malformed args / unknown format)

#### Workspace hooks (Stop hook gate)

While the multi-layer defenses guard the _shape_ of tool calls, hooks verify the _consistency between the response content and actual tool execution_. At turn end, an external process (hook) receives the final response text and the list of executed tools; if it returns block, the feedback is injected as a system message and exactly one continuation round runs.

- The contract is compatible with the Stop hooks of Claude Code / Codex CLI (stdin JSON, exit 0 + `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}` or exit 2 + stderr), so the same hook script can be shared across runtimes
- As a xangi extension, the payload includes `tools_called` (names of tools actually executed this turn, in order). Since the harness itself knows about tool execution, hooks do not need to parse a transcript
- Fail-open: any hook-side anomaly (timeout / invalid output / spawn failure / broken config) passes through. The guard never wedges the main response
- Mode-linked: in tool-disabled mode (chat) the gate itself is skipped. Blocking when the LLM has no means to act on the feedback degrades response quality — the model tends to emit pseudo tool_call text instead (observed on real hardware)
- One nudge per turn: the continuation round's result is not re-checked. A hook is not an enforcer but a device that inserts one verification before the turn ends
- Implementation: `src/hooks.ts` (config loading + `StopHookRunner`), `LocalLlmRunner.applyStopHookGate()` (wired into both `run` and `runStream`). Firings are recorded in the tool trajectory as `stop_hook_block` events
- History consistency: on block, the session history receives `assistant(original)` → `system(feedback)` → `assistant(continuation)` in order, so later turns can trace what happened

#### Observability: tool trajectory

To enable later analysis of when the multi-layer defenses fire, what `tool_search` adopted, and how `drift_rescue` decided safety, `src/tool-trajectory/` writes a separate structured observability log. The existing `transcript-logger` (`logs/sessions/`) is untouched; events are appended as one-line JSON to `logs/tool-trajectory/<appSessionId>.jsonl`.

Design points:

- Common fields: `ts` / `event_id` / `kind` / `schema_version=1` / `appSessionId` / `seq` / `turn_index` / `round` / `platform` / `backend` / `model` / `channelId_hash`
- Kinds: `session_start` / `tool_call` / `tool_search` / `drift_rescue` / `loop_detected` / `runner_event`
- Mandatory sanitization: secret-like keys → `[REDACTED_SECRET]`, Discord+LINE IDs → salted sha256 hash, `$HOME` substitution, head/tail truncation
- Retention: disabled by default (TTL / size cap only activate when explicitly configured via env). The logger preserves raw observation data by default. One session = one file, no rotation
- Fail-safe: write failures emit `console.warn` only, never throw — runner is never taken down by the logger
- Session restore never reads `logs/tool-trajectory/`, so the two paths are fully isolated

Set `XANGI_TOOL_TRAJECTORY_LOG=false` to disable the logger entirely (no files created). The runner only emits observation events; downstream processing of the accumulated JSONL is left to separate tooling. See `docs/usage.md` "Tool Trajectory Logger" for full details.

### Scheduler (scheduler.ts)

Manages periodic execution and reminders:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Scheduler                                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ - schedules: Schedule[]      # Schedule data        │
│ - cronJobs: Map<id, CronJob> # Running cron jobs    │
│ - senders: Map<platform, fn> # Message send funcs   │
│ - agentRunners: Map<platform, fn> # AI exec funcs   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ + add(schedule): Schedule                          │
│ + remove(id): boolean                              │
│ + toggle(id): Schedule                             │
│ + list(): Schedule[]                               │
│ + startAll(): void                                 │
│ + stopAll(): void                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Schedule Types:**

- `cron`: Periodic execution via cron expressions
- `once`: One-time reminder (executes once at a specified time)

**Persistence:**

- JSON file (`${DATA_DIR}/schedules.json`)
- Monitors file changes for automatic reload (with debounce)

**Timezone:**

- Follows the server's system timezone (`TZ` environment variable)
- In Docker environments, setting `TZ=Asia/Tokyo` etc. is recommended

**Execution Resilience:**

- Duplicate-fire guard: if a cron fires while the previous run of the same schedule is still in progress, the new fire is skipped (prevents duplicate runs / duplicate posts for long jobs)
- Transient network errors (temporary DNS failures, connect timeouts, etc.) are retried once after a backoff. Agent-side timeouts and usage limits are not retried

### Tool Server (tool-server.ts)

An HTTP API server that allows AI CLIs to safely invoke xangi features (Discord operations, scheduling, system control).

```
AI CLI (Claude Code, etc.)
  → xangi-cmd (shell script)
  → HTTP POST http://localhost:<port>/api/execute
  → tool-server (inside xangi process)
  → Discord REST API / Scheduler / Settings
```

**Port Management:**

- The previously used port is saved in dataDir and reused across restarts (keeps stale `XANGI_TOOL_SERVER` references in resumed sessions working). Falls back to OS auto-assign if busy; `XANGI_TOOL_SERVER_PORT` pins a fixed port
- The started URL is injected into child processes as `XANGI_TOOL_SERVER`
- `xangi-cmd` connects using `XANGI_TOOL_SERVER`
- Execution context such as the current channel ID is passed to tool-server via the `context` field of the HTTP request

**Security:**

- Secrets such as DISCORD_TOKEN remain inside the xangi process only
- AI CLIs receive only safe environment variables via the whitelist in `safe-env.ts`
- GitHub App private keys are loaded into memory at startup; token generation is handled via the tool-server's `/github-token` endpoint (only short-lived tokens are accessible)

### Event Trigger (event-trigger.ts)

A mechanism to start an agent turn from an external event (build finished, CI result, new content detected, etc.). Previously there were only two ways to start an agent turn: an incoming platform message and a scheduler fire. This adds a third: external events.

```
External process (build script / CI / watcher cron)
  → HTTP POST /api/trigger (Bearer token auth)
  → EventTrigger (validation, rate limiting)
  → agentRunner(prompt, channelId) registered on the scheduler
  → agent turn runs → result posted to the channel
```

**Design decisions:**

- Turn execution reuses the scheduler's `agentRunner` path. The per-platform run functions (thinking message, splitting, attachments, Stop / extend / remaining-time controls) are already registered on the scheduler, so the trigger only needs `Scheduler.getAgentRunner(platform)`
- The HTTP response (`202` + `triggerId`) is fire-and-forget and does not wait for the turn, so callers (build scripts etc.) are never blocked
- A `⚡ trigger: <source>` label is posted to the channel first, making it visible what woke the agent

**Security:**

- Explicit opt-in via `TRIGGER_ENABLED` (default: false)
- HTTP requests require Bearer auth with `XANGI_TRIGGER_TOKEN`. If the token is not configured, all requests are rejected even when enabled (the tool-server binds 0.0.0.0, so unauthenticated acceptance would allow arbitrary prompt injection over the network). Token comparison is constant-time
- `xangi-cmd trigger` (via `/api/execute`) follows the existing trust boundary of local commands and skips token verification, but still requires the opt-in
- Abuse protection: per-source rate limiting (`TRIGGER_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, default 10s, `429` on excess) and a concurrent-run guard (`409` while the same source is running). Message length capped at 4000 chars

### Approval Flow (approval.ts / approval-server.ts)

Detects dangerous commands (e.g., `rm -rf`, `git push --force`) in AI output and requires user approval before execution.

```
AI CLI outputs command
  → approval.ts pattern matches (approval-patterns.json)
  → Dangerous command detected
  → approval-server.ts sends button-attached message to Discord/Slack
  → User approves/rejects
  → Result returned to AI CLI
```

- Enabled via `APPROVAL_ENABLED=true` (disabled by default)
- Patterns defined in `src/approval-patterns.json`

### GitHub App Authentication (github-auth.ts)

Generates Installation Tokens (short-lived, 1-hour validity) using a GitHub App private key and wraps both the `gh` CLI and GitHub HTTPS credentials for `git`.

```
gh command execution (inside AI CLI)
  → /tmp/xangi-gh-wrapper/gh (wrapper)
  → curl to tool-server's /github-token endpoint
  → github-auth.ts generates token using in-memory private key
  → Injected as GH_TOKEN → exec real gh

git fetch/push/ls-remote etc. (inside AI CLI)
  → /tmp/xangi-gh-wrapper/git (wrapper)
  → Disable existing credential helpers and install the GitHub HTTPS helper
  → Fetch /github-token only when Git asks for credentials
  → Return x-access-token user + installation token
```

- Private key is read from file into memory at startup; file access is no longer needed
- AI agent (child processes) cannot directly access the private key
- No fallback to PAT on token generation failure (errors out)
- The wrapper directory is pinned to the front of child-process `PATH` and re-applied through `BASH_ENV`, so regular `gh` / `git` binaries do not shadow the wrappers when non-interactive shells rebuild `PATH` from startup files
- The `git` wrapper only affects GitHub HTTPS credentials and does not intercept SSH remotes.

### Trigger Feature (local-llm/triggers.ts)

In Local LLM chat mode, detects magic words in LLM response text and automatically executes scripts.

```
triggers/
├── my-trigger/
│   ├── trigger.yaml    # Defines name, description, handler
│   └── handler.sh      # Execution script
```

- Reads `trigger.yaml` from the workspace's `triggers/` directory
- Executes the handler when trigger words are found in LLM response text

### Skill System (skills.ts)

Loads skills from the `skills/` directory in the workspace and registers them as slash commands.

```
skills/
├── my-skill/
│   ├── SKILL.md      # Skill definition
│   └── scripts/      # Execution scripts
└── another-skill/
    └── SKILL.md
```

## Data Flow

### Message Processing Flow

```
1. User sends a message
   ↓
2. Discord/Slack client receives it
   ↓
3. Permission check (allowedUsers)
   ↓
4. Special command detection
   - /command → Slash command handling
   ↓
5. Attach channel info and sender info
   ↓
6. Prefetch recent history only for the first provider turn
   - Discord: channel / thread history
   - Slack: conversations.history / conversations.replies
   - Web: session JSONL
   ↓
7. Forward to AI CLI (processPrompt)
   ↓
8. Response processing
   - Streaming display
   - File attachment extraction (MEDIA: pattern)
   ↓
9. Reply to user
```

Prefetched history is wrapped as quoted data so instructions inside it are not treated as system instructions. `HISTORY_PREFETCH_ENABLED` and `HISTORY_PREFETCH_COUNT` are shared across all three platforms. Per-stage latency is recorded in `logs/turn-latency/<platform>.jsonl`.

### Schedule Execution Flow

```
1. Cron/timer triggers
   ↓
2. Scheduler.executeSchedule()
   ↓
3. agentRunner(prompt, channelId)
   - Execute prompt via AI CLI
   ↓
4. sender(channelId, result)
   - Send result to channel
   ↓
5. Auto-delete if one-time
```

## Design Philosophy

### User Management

xangi's user management uses a simple allowlist approach:

- Access control via `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER` / `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER`
- Multiple users can be specified with commas; `*` allows everyone
- Sessions are managed per channel
- Sender info (display name, Discord ID) is automatically injected into the prompt

### AI CLI Abstraction

Hides AI CLI implementation details and makes them interchangeable:

```typescript
// Switch backends via configuration
AGENT_BACKEND = claude - code; // or codex / cursor / grok / antigravity / local-llm
```

When new AI CLIs emerge in the future, support can be added simply by creating a new adapter.

### Autonomous Command Execution

Detects and automatically executes special commands output by the AI:

| Method        | Command Example                                                          | Action                                                                                                                                            |

CLI tools (`xangi-cmd`) are executed via xangi's built-in tool-server (HTTP endpoint).
Secrets such as DISCORD_TOKEN are confined to the xangi process and cannot be accessed from AI CLIs.

### Attachment extraction (read leniently, attach narrowly)

The logic that pulls file paths out of the AI's response text and attaches them (`extractFilePaths` in `src/file-utils.ts`) is designed around format-drift: "read leniently, but keep the set of attachable locations narrow".

Background: Local LLMs (e.g. Gemma 4) emit attachment syntax inconsistently. Besides the canonical `MEDIA:/path`, they tend to hallucinate training-data conventions like `[IMAGE:outputs/foo.png]` or `![alt](foo.png)`. The old parser did not recognize these, causing "the image was generated but nothing got attached" failures. The old parser also accepted any absolute `/path.png` unconditionally, which could attach unintended files (e.g. under `/etc/...`).

Defense is three-layered: canonical tool route + lenient parsing of explicit markers + sandbox:

1. Canonical = the `send_file` tool → structured `RunResult.attachments` (see below). The intended route for delivering generated files.
2. Lenient parser = `extractFilePaths`. Rescue for when the LLM doesn't call send_file and instead writes attachment intent into the response text. **Explicit markers only**:
   - `MEDIA:path`
   - `[IMAGE:|FILE:|VIDEO:|AUDIO:|MEDIA:path]` (bracket markers)
   - `![alt](path)` / `[label](path)` (markdown)
   - No "bare path in prose" tier — the false-positive risk (an incidental path string getting attached) outweighs the benefit and widens the attack surface.
3. Sandbox = every candidate is canonicalized via `fs.realpathSync` before a `startsWith` check against allowlist roots (entire WORKSPACE subtree, the attachment store, `/tmp`, `ATTACHMENT_ALLOWED_DIRS`). This blocks `..` / symlink escapes and doubles as the existence / file-vs-directory check.

- Relative paths are resolved against `WORKSPACE_PATH` (the old code resolved against cwd and missed them).
- Crucially, the leniency change also closes the "unconditional absolute-path attachment" hole — adding leniency alone would otherwise loosen security.
- As a backup, the shared chat-platform prompt (`xangi-commands-chat-platform.ts`) explicitly instructs models to emit `MEDIA:/absolute/path` and avoid `[IMAGE:]` etc., so tool, parser, and prompt defend in layers.

#### Structured attachment channel (RunResult.attachments)

Scraping paths from text (layer 2) is a rescue, not the intended path. Local LLMs have a dedicated `send_file` tool, and calling it is the canonical route:

- `send_file(path)` validates via `resolveAttachmentPath` (sharing the same realpath + allowlist sandbox above) and registers the realpath with the runner through the `ToolContext.attachFile` callback. It writes no `MEDIA:` into its output text — the text round-trip was redundant and a source of double-attachment, so the structured channel is the single path.
- The runner (`LocalLLMRunner`) collects attachments per-call (keyed by channelId) and returns them as `RunResult.attachments: string[]`. The Discord/Slack send path merges `extractFilePaths(text)` (text rescue) with `RunResult.attachments` (structured), deduping by realpath.
- The structured channel does not depend on a text round-trip, so attachments survive even if the response text drifts or gets stripped.
- The prompt also nudges models to "always call `send_file` after producing a file, don't just write the path in the reply".

### Persistence Strategy

#### Environment file persistence and Docker security design

`/autoreply`, `/notify`, and `/threadmode` use `settings.json`; `/respondtobots`, `/backend`, and `/llmmode` use `.env` write-back. When these slash commands run inside a Discord thread, they read and write the parent channel's settings rather than the thread ID. `.env` persistence has **two layers** that are easy to confuse, so we spell them out:

**Layer 1: Startup-time env var injection (always active)**

Values in the host `.env` are injected into the container as env vars at startup via Docker's `env_file` directive. This is independent of file write-back and works the same way in Docker and locally:

- Host `.env` initial values are guaranteed to land in `process.env` at startup.
- Every container restart re-injects the same env vars, so **initial values survive restarts**.
- To change them in production, edit host `.env` and restart the container (the canonical deploy path).

**Layer 2: Runtime write-back (skipped by default in Docker)**

When a slash command like `/respondtobots`, `/backend`, or `/llmmode` flips an in-memory setting, whether that change is written back to the host `.env` is decided by `resolveEnvFilePath()` in `src/env-persist.ts`:

| Environment            | Default behaviour                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local direct execution | Read/write `process.cwd()/.env` → dynamic changes are persisted and survive restarts.                                                                                               |
| Docker                 | `process.cwd() = /app`, but `/app/.env` does not exist, so write-back fails → only the in-memory state is updated, and a restart reverts to Layer 1's initial value (safe default). |

Skipping write-back inside Docker is intentional: container images shouldn't have `.env` mutated by chat-driven slash commands from outside, so the image-rebuild / re-deploy lifecycle is preserved as the source of truth. `updateEnvKeyValue()` returns `{ok: false, reason}` instead of throwing on ENOENT; the caller emits a `console.warn` noting "not persisted" while keeping the in-memory state updated.

**Opt-in to enable Layer 2 in Docker**: when the operator explicitly wants chat-driven write-back (e.g., a closed home network with clearly bounded trust), mount a writable `.env` and set `XANGI_ENV_PATH`:

```yaml
services:
  xangi:
    volumes:
      - ./.env:/workspace/.env:rw
    environment:
      - XANGI_ENV_PATH=/workspace/.env
```

`XANGI_ENV_PATH` is opt-in — without it, the safe default (skip write) remains in effect.

### Session Management

Sessions are managed using xangi's own `appSessionId`. The backend's `providerSessionId` (e.g., Claude Code's session_id) is saved after the response.

**sessions.json Structure:**

```json
{
  "activeByContext": { "<contextKey>": "<appSessionId>" },
  "sessions": {
    "<appSessionId>": {
      "id": "<appSessionId>",
      "title": "...",
      "platform": "discord|slack|web",
      "contextKey": "<channelId>",
      "agent": { "backend": "claude-code", "providerSessionId": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

### Transcript Logs

Automatically saves per-session AI conversation logs in JSONL format. Used for debugging, incident analysis, and WebUI browsing.

**Directory Structure:**

```
logs/sessions/
  m4abc123_def456.jsonl   # Per-session logs
  m4xyz789_ghi012.jsonl
```

**Recorded Content:**

- `user`: Prompt sent by the user
- `assistant`: AI's final response
- `error`: Timeouts, API errors, etc.

**Notes:**

- Logs are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Automatic rotation (directory split by date)
- Log write failures are ignored (no impact on core functionality)

## Docker Architecture

### Container Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ xangi-max / xangi-gpu container         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ - Node.js 22 + AI CLI + uv + Python    │
│ - xangi-gpu additionally has CUDA +    │
│   PyTorch                               │
└───────────────┬─────────────────────────┘

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ llama-server container (optional)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Security Policy

- Runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
- Only the workspace is mounted
- Environment variables for the AI agent are restricted via whitelist (`src/safe-env.ts`)
- No direct access to host network (only via ollama container)

For details (environment variable reference, Docker operation methods, etc.), see the [Usage Guide](usage.md).

## Extension Points

### Adding a New Chat Platform

1. Add client initialization code (see `src/line.ts` for a minimal `http.createServer`-based webhook implementation)
2. Implement the message handler (use `ensureSession` + `runWithBubbleEvents` to connect to the existing Runner)
3. Extend the `Platform` type (`events-emitter.ts`) and `ChatPlatform` type (`prompts/index.ts`) with the new platform name
4. Add platform settings (`enabled` / token / allowed users / etc.) to `config.ts`
5. Add the startup branch in `main()` inside `index.ts`
6. If needed, register the send/AI execution callbacks via `scheduler.registerSender()` / `scheduler.registerAgentRunner()`

### Adding a New AI CLI

1. Implement the `AgentRunner` interface
2. Add backend configuration to `config.ts`
3. Add initialization logic to `index.ts`
