# Slack App Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions to create a Slack App for using xangi on Slack.

## 1. Access the Slack API

https://api.slack.com/apps

Log in with your Slack account.

## 2. Create a New App

1. Click **"Create New App"**
2. Select **"From scratch"**
3. App Name: `xangi` (or any name you prefer)
4. Select your workspace
5. Click **"Create App"**

### Optional: Create from a Manifest

If you select **"From an app manifest"** when creating the Slack App, you can configure Socket Mode / Event Subscriptions / OAuth scopes in one step. Paste the following manifest if you want to reduce manual setup.

```yaml
display_information:
  name: xangi
  description: AI CLI assistant for Slack
  background_color: '#2f3136'
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: xangi
    always_online: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - app_mentions:read
      - channels:history
      - channels:read
      - chat:write
      - files:read
      - groups:history
      - groups:read
      - im:history
      - im:read
      - im:write
      - reactions:read
      - reactions:write
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.channels
      - message.groups
      - message.im
      - reaction_added
  interactivity:
    is_enabled: true
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: true
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Even when using the manifest, you still need to create an App-Level Token (`connections:write`), install the app to the workspace, and copy the Bot User OAuth Token / App Token. Slash commands are not included in the manifest to avoid environment-specific Request URL behavior; add them manually in Step 6 only if needed.

## 3. Enable Socket Mode (Important)

xangi operates in Socket Mode (no Webhook required).

1. Click **"Socket Mode"** in the left menu
2. Turn **"Enable Socket Mode"** ON
3. Create an App-Level Token:
   - Token Name: `xangi-socket`
   - Scopes: `connections:write`
   - Click **"Generate"**
4. **Copy the displayed App Token (xapp-...)**

## 4. Event Subscriptions Settings

1. Click **"Event Subscriptions"** in the left menu
2. Turn **"Enable Events"** ON
3. Under **"Subscribe to bot events"**, add the following:

| Event              | Description                       | Purpose                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `app_mention`      | When the bot is mentioned         | Required                        |
| `reaction_added`   | When a deletion reaction is added | For reaction-based deletion     |
| `message.im`       | When a DM is received             | For DM support                  |
| `message.channels` | Messages in public channels       | For responding without mentions |
| `message.groups`   | Messages in private channels      | For responding without mentions |

> **Warning**: `message.channels` / `message.groups` are required if you use `SLACK_AUTO_REPLY_CHANNELS`

## 5. OAuth & Permissions Settings

1. Click **"OAuth & Permissions"** in the left menu
2. Under **"Scopes"** → **"Bot Token Scopes"**, add the following:

| Scope               | Description                      | Purpose                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `app_mentions:read` | Read mentions                    | Required                        |
| `chat:write`        | Send messages                    | Required                        |
| `files:read`        | Read files                       | For file attachment support     |
| `reactions:read`    | Read reaction events             | For reaction-based deletion     |
| `reactions:write`   | Add reactions (e.g. eyes emoji)  | Required                        |
| `im:history`        | Read DM history                  | For DM support                  |
| `im:read`           | Read DMs                         | For DM support                  |
| `im:write`          | Send DMs                         | For DM support                  |
| `channels:read`     | Read public channel information  | For `xangi-cmd slack_channels`  |
| `groups:read`       | Read private channel information | For `xangi-cmd slack_channels`  |
| `channels:history`  | Read public channel history      | For responding without mentions |
| `groups:history`    | Read private channel history     | For responding without mentions |

After adding or changing scopes/events, reinstall the app from **"Install App"** in the left menu. Without reinstalling, `reaction_added` and `reactions:read` will not take effect.

## 6. Register Slash Commands (Optional)

1. Click **"Slash Commands"** in the left menu
2. Create the following commands:

| Command   | Description                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/new`    | Start a new session                             |
| `/skills` | List available skills                           |
| `/skill`  | Run a skill (Usage Hint: `<skill-name> [args]`) |

> **Note**: Request URL is not needed in Socket Mode.

## 7. Install to Workspace

1. Click **"Install App"** in the left menu
2. Click **"Install to Workspace"**
3. Review permissions and click **"Allow"**
4. **Copy the displayed Bot User OAuth Token (xoxb-...)**

## 8. Set the tokens

```bash
xangi settings
```

Paste the Bot Token (xoxb-...) and App Token (xapp-...) into the Slack fields on the local settings page and save them.

In a source checkout, non-secret advanced settings such as allowed user IDs can still be placed in `.env`:

```bash
# Allowed user ID (Slack User ID)
SLACK_ALLOWED_USER=U01234567

# Optional: Post replies directly in specific channels instead of threads
SLACK_REPLY_IN_CHANNELS=C01234567

# Optional: Delete bot messages with `:wastebasket:` / `:x:` reactions (enabled by default)
SLACK_REACTION_DELETE_ENABLED=true
SLACK_DELETE_REACTIONS=wastebasket,x
```

> When using only Slack, leave the Discord field unconfigured in `xangi settings`.

## 9. Verify It Works

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Start with Docker
docker compose up -d --build

# Check logs
docker compose logs -f xangi
```

Try the following in Slack:

- Mention the bot: `@xangi Hello!`
- Send a DM
- `/new` command
- `/skills` command
- Add a `:wastebasket:` or `:x:` reaction to a bot message to delete it

## How to Find IDs

### User ID

1. Open the user's profile
2. Click **"..."** (More) → **"Copy member ID"**

### Channel ID

**Method 1:** From the link

1. Right-click the channel name → **"Copy link"**
2. The channel ID is at the end of the URL: `https://xxx.slack.com/archives/C01234567` — `C01234567` is the ID

**Method 2:** From channel info

1. Open the channel → Click the channel name
2. The **Channel ID** is displayed at the bottom

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Doesn't Respond

1. Verify Socket Mode is enabled
2. Verify `app_mention` and `message.im` are set in Event Subscriptions
3. Verify the bot has been invited to the channel (`/invite @xangi`)
4. Verify `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER` is set to the correct Slack User ID

### Slash Commands Don't Work

1. Verify the commands are registered in Slash Commands
2. Reinstall the app (required after permission changes)

### "Slack tokens not configured" Error

Open `xangi settings` and confirm that both Slack fields are marked as configured.

### Bot Doesn't Respond in DMs

1. Verify `im:history` and `im:read` are in OAuth Scopes
2. Verify `message.im` is set in Event Subscriptions

## Inviting the Bot to a Channel

To use the bot in a channel, you need to invite it:

```
/invite @xangi
```

## Security Notes

- **Never paste tokens into Git or an AI conversation**
- **Never expose tokens publicly** (regenerate in Slack App settings if leaked)
- `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER` restricts usage to a single user (in compliance with Claude Code Terms of Service)
